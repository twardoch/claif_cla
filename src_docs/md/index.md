# claif_cla Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **claif_cla**, a Claif provider for Anthropic's Claude that offers full OpenAI client API compatibility.

## üöÄ Quick TLDR

**claif_cla** is a Python package that provides a unified interface to interact with Anthropic's Claude AI models using the familiar OpenAI client API pattern. It wraps the `claude-code-sdk` while adding session management, tool approval strategies, response caching, and a rich CLI interface.

### Key Features at a Glance

- ‚úÖ **OpenAI API Compatible** - Drop-in replacement using `client.chat.completions.create()`
- üîÑ **Session Management** - Persistent conversation history with atomic operations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Tool Approval** - Fine-grained control over MCP tool usage with 8+ strategies
- ‚ö° **Response Caching** - Intelligent caching to reduce API costs
- üé® **Rich CLI** - Beautiful terminal interface with Fire framework
- üîí **Type Safety** - Full type hints and returns standard OpenAI objects
- üìä **Streaming Support** - Real-time streaming responses

### Installation & Quick Start

```bash
# Install package
pip install claif_cla

# Basic usage - OpenAI compatible
from claif_cla import ClaudeClient
client = ClaudeClient()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello Claude!'}],
    model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

# CLI usage
claif-cla query "Explain quantum computing" --model claude-3-opus-20240229
```
