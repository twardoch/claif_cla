# claif_cla Development Plan - v1.0 MVP Stability Focus

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Create a stable, reliable v1.0 claif_cla provider that wraps claude-code-sdk with 99%+ reliability.

**Current Status**: ✅ STABLE v1.0 READY! All critical blocking issues resolved. Test infrastructure stable, SDK import handling robust, and Message auto-conversion working correctly.

**Release Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - 80%+ test coverage verified, async issues resolved, robust session management, clear error handling implemented.

## Critical Stability Phase ✅ COMPLETED

### Test Suite Verification ✅ COMPLETED
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Verify test coverage accuracy** - Full pytest suite running, 80%+ coverage achieved ✅
- [x] **Fix test environment issues** - Tests pass reliably in clean environments ✅
- [x] **Complete mocking** - No external claude-code-sdk dependencies in tests ✅
- [x] **Test error conditions** - All error handling paths validated ✅

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - Tests pass reliably, coverage accurate, error paths tested

### Critical Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep** - Verified no blocking calls found, already using asyncio.sleep correctly ✅
- [x] **Fix SDK import issues** - Enhanced try/except blocks with comprehensive mock classes implemented ✅
- [x] **Session file safety** - Atomic operations and concurrent access handling ✅
- [x] **Resource cleanup** - Proper cleanup and no memory leaks ✅
- [x] **Test infrastructure fixes** - Updated Mock objects to use real ClaudeMessage for auto-conversion ✅

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - No blocking calls, SDK imports robust, sessions safe, no leaks, tests passing

### Essential Functionality Validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Auto-install verification** - Auto-install logic working correctly ✅
- [x] **Basic operations work** - Query, session management, approval strategies functional ✅
- [x] **Error handling completeness** - Clear messages for all failure modes ✅

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - All basic functionality works reliably

## Release Readiness Phase (Required for v1.0)

### Cross-Platform Reliability
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
