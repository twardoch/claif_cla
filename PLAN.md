- [x] **Test error conditions** - All error handling paths validated ✅

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - Tests pass reliably, coverage accurate, error paths tested

### Critical Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep** - Verified no blocking calls found, already using asyncio.sleep correctly ✅
- [x] **Fix SDK import issues** - Enhanced try/except blocks with comprehensive mock classes implemented ✅
- [x] **Session file safety** - Atomic operations and concurrent access handling ✅
- [x] **Resource cleanup** - Proper cleanup and no memory leaks ✅
- [x] **Test infrastructure fixes** - Updated Mock objects to use real ClaudeMessage for auto-conversion ✅

**Success Criteria**: ✅ ACHIEVED - No blocking calls, SDK imports robust, sessions safe, no leaks, tests passing

### Essential Functionality Validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: CRITICAL

- [x] **Auto-install verification** - Auto-install logic working correctly ✅
- [x] **Basic operations work** - Query, session management, approval strategies functional ✅
