# claif_cla Development Plan

## Project Vision

`claif_cla` is a thin, focused wrapper around `claude-code-sdk` that integrates Claude's capabilities into the CLAIF (Command-Line AI Framework) ecosystem. The goal is to provide a minimal yet complete interface that preserves all Claude-specific features while enabling seamless integration with other CLAIF providers.

## MVP 1.0 Scope (Current Release)

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [x] Thin wrapper around claude-code-sdk with minimal overhead
- [x] CLAIF options to ClaudeCodeOptions conversion
- [x] Async message streaming support
- [x] Basic error handling and logging

### ✅ CLI Features
- [x] Fire-based CLI with rich terminal output
- [x] Basic commands: ask, stream, interactive
- [x] Session management: create, list, show, delete, export
- [x] Health check and benchmarking
- [x] Interactive mode with command support

### ✅ Session Management
- [x] Persistent session storage in JSON format
- [x] Session branching and merging
- [x] Export to JSON and Markdown
- [x] Session templates for common use cases

### ✅ Tool Approval
- [x] Multiple approval strategies (8 types implemented)
- [x] Composite strategies with AND/OR logic
- [x] Strategy presets for common scenarios
- [x] Factory pattern for strategy creation

### ✅ Infrastructure
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [x] Pre-commit hooks
- [x] Test framework setup
- [x] Build and packaging configuration
- [x] Python 3.10+ support

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Version 1.1 - Enhanced Integration
- [ ] Full MCP tool integration with Claude
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies (content-aware caching)
- [ ] Session compression for large conversations
- [ ] Real-time session synchronization across instances

### Version 1.2 - Developer Experience
- [ ] VS Code extension integration
- [ ] Jupyter notebook support
- [ ] Session visualization tools
- [ ] Performance profiling commands

### Version 1.3 - Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-model conversations (Claude + other providers)
- [ ] Session templates marketplace
- [ ] Plugin system for custom strategies
- [ ] Advanced retry strategies with circuit breakers

## Design Principles

1. **Minimal Overhead**: The wrapper should add minimal complexity to claude-code-sdk
2. **Feature Preservation**: All Claude-specific features must remain accessible
3. **CLAIF Compatibility**: Seamless integration with the CLAIF ecosystem
4. **Developer First**: Excellent developer experience with clear APIs
5. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling, logging, and monitoring

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- Thin wrapper pattern to minimize maintenance burden
- Direct pass-through of claude-code-sdk types where possible
- Separate concerns: CLI, session management, approval strategies

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies (fire, rich, claude-code-sdk, claif)
- No heavy frameworks or complex abstractions
- Standard library preferred where possible

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mocked Claude responses
- E2E tests for CLI commands (future)
- Property-based testing for session operations (future)

## Release Strategy

### 1.0.0 (Current)
- Core functionality complete
- Basic documentation
- CI/CD pipeline established
- Published to PyPI

### 1.x Releases
- Bug fixes and minor enhancements
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Community-requested features

### 2.0.0 (Future)
- Breaking changes only if absolutely necessary
- Major architectural improvements
- Full MCP protocol support

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: Downloads from PyPI, GitHub stars
2. **Reliability**: < 0.1% error rate in production
3. **Performance**: < 100ms overhead per query
4. **Developer Satisfaction**: Clear documentation, minimal issues
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with other CLAIF providers
