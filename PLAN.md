## Polish Phase (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Essential Documentation
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: MEDIUM

- **Installation guide** - Clear setup with troubleshooting
- **Basic usage examples** - Common operations and workflows
- **Session management guide** - Effective session usage
- **Error troubleshooting** - Solutions for common problems

**Success Criteria**: Users can install and use without confusion

### Code Quality
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: MEDIUM

- **Complete docstrings** - All public functions documented
- **Type hint coverage** - 100% type annotations
- **Code organization** - Clean module structure

**Success Criteria**: Professional code quality standards met

## Architecture Focus

### Module Structure (Current)
```
claif_cla/
├── __init__.py        # Clean public API ✅
├── wrapper.py         # SDK wrapper (needs async fixes)
├── cli.py            # CLI interface ✅
├── session.py        # Session management (needs safety)
├── approval.py       # Approval strategies ✅
├── install.py        # Cross-platform installer ✅
├── types.py          # Type definitions ✅
└── utils.py          # Utilities ✅
```

### Critical Module Improvements

#### wrapper.py (CRITICAL)
- Fix async/await usage (eliminate time.sleep)
- Improve SDK error handling and translation
- Add connection validation and retry logic
- Ensure proper resource cleanup

#### session.py (HIGH)
- Implement atomic file operations for safety
- Handle concurrent access properly
- Add session validation and corruption recovery
- Clear error messages for file issues

#### approval.py (MEDIUM)
- Validate strategy configurations
- Better logging of approval decisions
- Safe defaults for security
- Performance optimization

## Success Metrics for v1.0

### Reliability (Must Have)
- ✅ **99%+ success rate** for claude-code-sdk operations
- ✅ **No resource leaks** in normal operation
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** with clear messages
- ✅ **Stable async operations** - No blocking time.sleep calls

### Testing (Must Have)
- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** with verified accuracy
- ✅ **All critical paths tested** including error conditions
- ✅ **Mocked SDK dependencies** for reliable testing
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** verified

### User Experience (Should Have)
- ✅ **Auto-install works reliably** in clean environments
- ✅ **Clear error messages** for setup and usage problems
- ✅ **Session management** works predictably
- ✅ **Fast startup time** (<3 seconds including SDK load)

## Resource Allocation

### Critical Path (80% of effort)
1. **Async Correctness** (30%) - Fix time.sleep, proper async patterns
2. **Test Reliability** (25%) - Verify coverage, fix environment issues
3. **Error Handling** (15%) - Clear messages, edge case handling
4. **Session Safety** (10%) - Atomic operations, corruption prevention

### Secondary Path (20% of effort)
1. **Cross-Platform Testing** (10%) - Windows, macOS, Linux verification
2. **Documentation** (10%) - Installation guides, basic usage

## Risk Management

### High Risk Issues
1. **SDK dependency problems** → Could break core functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with different SDK versions
2. **Async/threading bugs** → Could cause hangs or crashes
   - **Mitigation**: Replace all time.sleep, proper async patterns
3. **Session corruption** → Could lose user data
   - **Mitigation**: Atomic file operations, validation, backups

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **Cross-platform compatibility** → Could limit adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Test matrix with GitHub Actions
2. **Error messaging** → Could cause user confusion
   - **Mitigation**: User testing of error scenarios

## Non-Goals for v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Advanced session features** (templates, search, archiving)
- ❌ **Response caching** mechanisms
- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Complex approval strategies** beyond basic safety
- ❌ **Multi-user support** or collaboration
- ❌ **Custom SDK modifications**
