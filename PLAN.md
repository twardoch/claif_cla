# claif_cla Development Plan

## Project Vision

`claif_cla` is a thin, focused wrapper around `claude-code-sdk` that integrates Claude's capabilities into the CLAIF (Command-Line AI Framework) ecosystem. The goal is to provide a minimal yet complete interface that preserves all Claude-specific features while enabling seamless integration with other CLAIF providers.

## Current Status (v1.0.1)

### âœ… Completed Features

#### Core Functionality

- Thin wrapper around claude-code-sdk with minimal overhead
- CLAIF options to ClaudeCodeOptions conversion
- Async message streaming support
- Direct loguru logging integration
- Basic error handling

#### CLI Features

- Fire-based CLI with rich terminal output
- Basic commands: ask, stream, interactive
- Session management: create, list, show, delete, export
- Health check and benchmarking
- Interactive mode with command support

#### Session Management

- Persistent session storage in JSON format
- Session branching and merging
- Export to JSON and Markdown
- Session templates (code_review, debugging, architecture, testing)

#### Tool Approval

- 8 approval strategies implemented
- Composite strategies with AND/OR logic
- Strategy presets for common scenarios
- Factory pattern for strategy creation

#### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Pre-commit hooks configured
- Basic test framework
- Python 3.10+ support
- Published to PyPI

## Near-term Goals (v1.1)

### Essential Improvements

- [ ] Add proper error handling for missing API keys
- [ ] Implement async cleanup in wrapper
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running queries
- [ ] Create integration tests with mocked Claude responses
- [ ] Improve test coverage to >80%

### Documentation

- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create more usage examples
- [ ] Document all CLI commands with examples

## Future Considerations (v1.2+)

### Enhanced Features

- [ ] Session search functionality
- [ ] Session tags and metadata
- [ ] Performance profiling commands
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### Integration Improvements

- [ ] Better MCP tool integration
- [ ] Cross-provider session compatibility
- [ ] Plugin system for custom strategies

## Design Principles

1. **Minimal Overhead**: Keep the wrapper thin and maintainable
2. **Feature Preservation**: All Claude-specific features remain accessible
3. **CLAIF Compatibility**: Seamless integration with the CLAIF ecosystem
4. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and logging
5. **Developer First**: Clear APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture

- Thin wrapper pattern to minimize maintenance burden
- Direct pass-through of claude-code-sdk types where possible
- Separate concerns: CLI, session management, approval strategies

### Dependencies

- Minimal external dependencies
- Standard library preferred where possible
- Direct loguru usage for simplified logging

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mocked responses
- Property-based testing for complex operations

## Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**: < 0.1% error rate in production
2. **Performance**: < 100ms overhead per query
3. **Code Quality**: >80% test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date
5. **Maintainability**: Simple codebase that's easy to understand
