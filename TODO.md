# claif_cla TODO List - v1.0 MVP Stability Focus

## CRITICAL (Blocking v1.0 Release)

### Test Suite Reliability
- [x] **Add comprehensive test suite** - Full pytest coverage for all modules ✅
- [x] **Mock claude-code-sdk completely** - No external dependencies in test suite ✅
- [ ] **Fix failing tests** - Update tests to expect List[TextBlock] instead of str
- [ ] **Test all error conditions** - Validate error handling paths with new Message behavior

### Critical Bug Fixes
- [ ] **Replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep** - Fix async correctness throughout codebase
- [ ] **Fix SDK import issues** - Resolve `claude_code` dependency problems
- [ ] **Improve error handling** - Clear, actionable error messages for all failure modes
- [ ] **Session file safety** - Prevent corruption, handle concurrent access

### Essential Functionality
- [ ] **Auto-install verification** - Ensure claude-code-sdk installs correctly
- [ ] **Basic operations work** - Query, session management, approval strategies function
- [ ] **Resource cleanup** - No memory leaks or hanging processes

## HIGH PRIORITY (Required for Stable Release)

### Cross-Platform Reliability
- [ ] **Test on Windows, macOS, Linux** - Verify all functionality works across platforms
- [ ] **Path handling robustness** - Support spaces, Unicode, special characters
- [ ] **Permission handling** - Proper error messages for permission issues
- [ ] **SDK installation paths** - Handle various installation locations

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Real SDK testing** - Test with actual claude-code-sdk when available
- [ ] **End-to-end workflows** - Complete user scenarios from install to query
- [ ] **Error recovery** - Network failures, timeouts, SDK crashes
- [ ] **Session persistence** - Data survives across runs

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.0)

### Essential Documentation
- [ ] **Installation guide** - Clear setup instructions with troubleshooting
- [ ] **Basic usage examples** - Common operations and workflows
- [ ] **Session management guide** - How to use sessions effectively
- [ ] **Error troubleshooting** - Solutions for common problems

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Complete docstrings** - All public functions documented
- [ ] **Type hint coverage** - 100% type annotations
- [ ] **Code organization** - Clean module structure and imports

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR v1.0

### Reliability (Must Have)
- ✅ **99%+ success rate** for basic claude-code-sdk operations
- ✅ **No resource leaks** in normal operation
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** with clear messages
- ✅ **Stable async operations** - No time.sleep blocking calls

### Testing (Must Have)
- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** with verified accuracy
- ✅ **All critical paths tested** including error conditions
- ✅ **Mocked SDK dependencies** for reliable testing
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** verified

### User Experience (Should Have)
- ✅ **Auto-install works reliably** in clean environments
- ✅ **Clear error messages** for setup and usage problems
- ✅ **Session management** works predictably
- ✅ **Fast startup time** (<3 seconds including SDK load)

## NON-GOALS FOR v1.0

Explicitly excluding to maintain focus:

- ❌ **Advanced session features** (templates, search, metadata)
- ❌ **Response caching** mechanisms
- ❌ **Performance optimization** beyond basic functionality
- ❌ **Complex approval strategies** beyond basic safety
- ❌ **Multi-user support** or collaboration features
- ❌ **Custom SDK modifications** or patches
- ❌ **Advanced configuration** options
- ❌ **Integration with other providers** beyond claif framework

## RISK MITIGATION

### High Risk Items
1. **SDK dependency issues** → Could break core functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with different SDK versions
2. **Async/threading bugs** → Could cause hangs or crashes
   - **Mitigation**: Replace all time.sleep, proper async patterns
3. **Session corruption** → Could lose user data
   - **Mitigation**: Atomic file operations, validation, backups

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Cross-platform compatibility** → Could limit adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Test matrix with GitHub Actions
2. **Error messaging** → Could cause user confusion
   - **Mitigation**: User testing of error scenarios

## MODULE FOCUS

### wrapper.py (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix async/await usage (no time.sleep)
- [ ] Improve SDK error handling and translation
- [ ] Add connection validation and retry logic
- [ ] Resource cleanup on errors

### session.py (HIGH)
- [ ] Atomic file operations for data safety
- [ ] Handle concurrent access properly
- [ ] Session validation and corruption recovery
- [ ] Clear error messages for file issues

### approval.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Validate strategy configurations
- [ ] Better logging of approval decisions
- [ ] Safe defaults for security
- [ ] Performance optimization

### cli.py (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Standardized help text and error display
- [ ] Progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Better argument validation
- [ ] Consistent output formatting

## DEFINITION OF DONE

For each task to be considered complete:

- [ ] **Implementation** meets requirements and handles edge cases
- [ ] **Tests** cover the functionality with mocks where appropriate
- [ ] **Error handling** includes clear, actionable messages
- [ ] **Documentation** updated for user-facing changes
- [ ] **Cross-platform** compatibility verified or documented limitations
- [ ] **Performance** impact measured and acceptable
