# claif_cla TODO List - Quality Focus v1.1

## ✅ COMPLETED - MVP v1.0

### Auto-Install Support (Issue #201) - ✅ COMPLETED






### Rich Dependencies - ✅ COMPLETED





### Core Architecture - ✅ COMPLETED






## High Priority - v1.1 Quality & Testing

### Unit Testing (80%+ Coverage Target)
- [ ] **Wrapper Tests**: Test Claude SDK integration with mocked responses
- [ ] **Session Tests**: Test session management with mocked file I/O
- [ ] **Approval Tests**: Test all approval strategies with various scenarios
- [ ] **CLI Tests**: Test command-line interface with subprocess mocking
- [ ] **Install Tests**: Test auto-install logic with mocked npm/bun operations

### Error Handling & User Experience
- [ ] **API Key Validation**: Improve missing API key error handling with actionable messages
- [ ] **Async Cleanup**: Replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep in wrapper
- [ ] **Timeout Handling**: Add proper timeout management for long-running queries
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Handle subprocess failures and cleanup gracefully
- [ ] **Specific Exceptions**: Add more specific exception types for different failure modes

### Documentation & Guides
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Complete documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Getting Started**: Comprehensive setup and usage guide
- [ ] **CLI Examples**: Document all CLI commands with real examples
- [ ] **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with main claif package

## Medium Priority - Release & Polish

### CLI Standardization
- [ ] **Version Flag**: Add `--version` flag for CLI
- [ ] **Help Consistency**: Standardize `--help` output format
- [ ] **Exit Codes**: Implement consistent exit code patterns
- [ ] **Verbosity Levels**: Standardize logging levels and verbose output

### Build & Release Automation
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] **PyPI Publishing**: Set up automated PyPI release workflow
- [ ] **Version Coordination**: Sync version bumps with main claif package
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Ensure all tests pass before releases

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Startup Time**: Optimize import time and CLI responsiveness
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Profile and optimize memory consumption
- [ ] **Subprocess Efficiency**: Optimize claude-code-sdk communication
- [ ] **Config Caching**: Cache configuration loading where beneficial

## Low Priority - Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features (v1.2+)
- [ ] Response caching with configurable TTL
- [ ] Enhanced session templates and management
- [ ] Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple queries
- [ ] Extended tool approval strategies

### Development Experience
- [ ] Enhanced debugging and profiling tools
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Advanced configuration options
- [ ] Plugin system for custom approval strategies

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Add more specific exception types
- [ ] Consider using pathlib throughout instead of string paths
- [ ] Enhance type hints and documentation

### Known Issues
- [ ] Session timestamps may lack timezone info
- [ ] Cache directory creation could fail silently
- [ ] No validation for claude-code-sdk responses

## Definition of Done for v1.1

### Quality Gates
- [ ] 80%+ unit test coverage on core modules
- [ ] All linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy) passes
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed and documented
- [ ] All CLI commands have `--help` and `--version`
- [ ] Package builds successfully with `python -m build`
- [ ] Auto-install functionality verified on clean systems

### Success Criteria
1. **Reliability**: No regressions from v1.0 functionality ✅
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage gives confidence in changes
3. **Documentation**: Users can easily understand and troubleshoot issues
4. **Quality**: Professional polish suitable for production use
5. **Automation**: Releases can be made confidently with automated testing

## Current Focus

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Set up comprehensive unit test framework
2. Create GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Add missing error handling and validation
4. Complete API documentation
5. Verify cross-platform testing

**Success Metrics Maintained:**
- Keep under 1000 lines of code total
- Maintain < 100ms overhead per query
- Preserve simple, clean architecture
- Ensure zero-setup user experience

The MVP is complete and working. Now we make it bulletproof with testing, documentation, and professional release automation.
